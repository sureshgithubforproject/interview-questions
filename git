2. What is Git? 
Git is a Distributed Version Control system(DVCS). 
It lets you track changes made to a file and 
allows you to revert back to any particular change that you wish.
It is a distributed architecture that provides many advantages over 
other Version Control Systems (VCS) like SVN. One of the major advantages 
is that it does not rely on a central server to store 
all the versions of a project’s files.
Instead, every developer “clones” a copy of a repository 
I have shown in the diagram with “Local repository” 
and has the full history of the project available on his hard drive. 
So when there is a server outage all you need to do to recover 
is one of your teammate’s local Git repository.
